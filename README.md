# Master's thesis: Semi-supervised brain hemorrhage segmentation using deep learning

This repository contains semi-supervised segmentation models for my Master's thesis. The implemented models are based on the following papers:

1. U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf
2. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation needs strong, varied perturbations: https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/78164/1/1906.01916.pdf
3. Deep semi-supervised segmentation with weight-averaged consistency targets: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04657.pdf
4. FixMatch: Simplifying Semi-Supervised Learning with Consistency and Confidence: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2001/2001.07685.pdf
